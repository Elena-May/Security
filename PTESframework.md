Penetration Test - trying to hack a company or website in order to solve the flaws
Metasploit - framework for penetration testing

## Chapter 1 (Metasploit book) - The absolute basics of penetration testing 
### Pre-engagement Interactions
Discuss the scope and terms of the penetration test with the client

### Intelligence Gathering
Gather any information you can about the organisation you are attacking by using social-media networks, Google hacking, footprinting the target etc
Seeing what ports get you blocked from the organisation
Test this from an expendable IP address that you don't mind being blocked and deleted
Could use an entirely different IP address to run very noisy scans and see how the company responds

### Threat Modelling
Identifying existing vulnerabilities on a target system
Looking at an organsiation as an adversery and attempting to exploit its weaknesses as an attacker would 

### Vulnerability Analysis
Combining the information you have learned from the prior phases and deciding what attacks might be viable 

### Exploitation 
Normally doen with brute force rather than precision
An exploit should only be performed only when you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that will be successful

### Post Exploitation
After one or more systems have been compromised
Must leanr what information has been made avaialable to you through exploitation and how that might effect the company

### Reporting 
Communicate what you did, how you did it and how the organsiation can fix the vulnerabilities discovered

## Types of Penetration Tests
### Overt Penetration Testing
The organisations IT or security team shows you the organisations systems 
Insider knowledge, can launch attacks without fear of being blocked
Good for limited time 

### Covert Penetration Testing
Performed without th eknowledge of most of the organisation
Performed to test the internal security teams ability to detect and respond to an attack 

### Vulnerability Scanners
Automated tools for identifying security flaws
Typically work by fingerprinting a target's operating system (identifying the version and type), as well as any services that are running 
Can have issues, only ever as good as there creators

### Conclusion
Pen testing is an experiment, like with any experiment, you must ensure you have a refined and adaptable process that is also repeatable
